# About Us

#### Here at PRO (The Producers and Remixers Organization) we are all about spreading worthwhile knowledge.  It is becoming increasingly more difficult to track down reliable sources on the internet without being marketed to.  We aim to change that by developing a community of like-minded individuals who support each other and grow together.  [Join our official Facebook group](https://www.facebook.com/groups/ProducerOrg/), where members can communicate, collaborate, and share information pertaining to music production. Anyone is welcome to join the group, even those new to electronic music!
